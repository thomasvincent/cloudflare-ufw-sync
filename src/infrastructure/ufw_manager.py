"""UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) manager for cloudflare-ufw-sync.

This module provides a wrapper around the UFW command-line tool to manage
firewall rules for Cloudflare IP ranges. It handles adding, deleting, and
synchronizing rules to ensure that only traffic from Cloudflare is allowed
through to protected services.
